            <p class="section-description">
I explored a range of free Bootstrap templates to better understand what the framework offers and to evaluate whether the designs align with current web design trends in typography, imagery, and overall style. While I did come across some clean and visually appealing templates, I noticed that several of them felt a bit dated, relying on design patterns that no longer look as modern or polished. Personally, I tend to prefer minimalistic and elegant websites, so I was pleased to find a few options that matched that aesthetic. Below, there are photos of my favorite templates.            </p>

                        <h3>Template #1</h3>
                        <p>
                     I liked this template because of its header, how it integrates with the background picture and has no buttons. I also liked the yellow button in the middle of the page, as I think it's a subtle call to action for users exploring my page.

                        <p>
                          I found this page interesting as the nav bar is on the left side of the page and not on top as it is usually seen. Also, it includes a photo and, while scrolling, the navigation bar remains fixed. The section you are currently viewing is highlighted in white, while the other sections turn gray, making it easy to see where you are on the page.

                         What caught my eye from this landing page was how the images can be seen so close to the short introduction of "I'm Jenny Wilson a Professional..." etc. I think it is interesting as the photos may catch people's attention and make them wander and take a closer look.

            <p class="section-description">
                From Shadcn UI, I explored a variety of components, including buttons, switches, drawers, accordions, carousels, and the menubar, among others. What stood out to me most about this website was its intuitiveness, both in terms of navigation and the clarity of its documentation. The component previews are not only visually well-presented but also make it easy to understand how each element can be customized and integrated. Compared to other websites on the list, Shadcn UI felt particularly user-friendly, striking a good balance between functionality and accessibility, which made the learning experience smoother. See the different images to find out which components where my favorite and why.

                        <p>
                         I found the airplane mode button playful, and useful as it conveys the idea of “disconnecting” or pausing activity. I could use it as a fun toggle to change languages or trigger a change in the website's layout, the possibilities are many.

                         The “Open Drawer” button caught my attention as the interaction felt seamless and intuitive, creating a smooth transition. Paired with a nearly full-page pop-up is effective because it allows users to access a large amount of information without leaving the current page.

                            The accordion component is commonly used, yet it remains appealing because it organizes content into collapsible sections, reducing visual clutter and making information easier to navigate and digest.

                        <p>
                            The alert dialog button is appealing because it adds a clear decision point, giving users control and reassurance. Creatively, the button doesn't need to say “alert dialog”; it could read something like “Click here to continue to my page”, with the pop-up delivering a playful or humorous message to engage the user.

            <p class="section-description">
               Jekyll is a program that helps you make websites from simple text. You write your content in Markdown or HTML, and Jekyll turns it into a website with pages that are ready to use. It uses templates to give your site a design and style, and small settings at the top of each file (like the title or date) tell Jekyll how to build each page. Below, I analyze a few Jekyll templates I found interesting.

                        <p>
                         What caught my attention in this template was its modern design, the navigation bar with its dark mode toggle and search bar, as well as the typography and the shde of vibrant blue. It felt modern overall and a plus is the clear use of a CTA button.

                        <p>
                          I found this template interesting because of its use of dark tones and subtle shades, which create a sleek and modern atmosphere compared to the other options I reviewed. Additionally, I liked  the header design, where the logo on the left, the navigation bar in the center, and the search bar on the right.

                            Although it appears simple at first, I chose to include this template in my analysis because I liked several of its features: the navigation bar, the night mode toggle, the typography, and the photo grid below the introduction. I also appreciated the small interactive details, such as the blue button changing color on hover and the navigation links' letters changing color, which add subtle yet engaging touches to the design.

            <p class="section-description">
I explored the page Anime.js and spent time searching through the different animations it offered. Honestly, there were many that I didn't quite understand, either how they worked, what their purpose was or how could I use them on a website. Still, I think it was one of the most fun pages I explored, and in the end I discovered some really interesting animations, as you can see below.

I liked the text animation because it adds personality, making the content feel more dynamic and engaging. It's a good idea to use it on a website since it helps capture attention quickly and it makes the website feel more modern and interactive.

                        <p>
             I really liked the cursor animation because it felt unique and playful. It's not visible in the photo but the group of circles move with a certain curve to it, making it more innoative. I had never seen this type of animation before, which made the interaction feel memorable. It's a great animation for a website since it surprises users and adds a creative touch.

                        <p>
I liked this animation as it breaks the usual pattern of vertical scrolling and feels more interactive. Scrolling horizontally is becoming more common on websites, but I still believe it feels more original and unexpected than scrolling down. The square moving around adds a fun and playful touch to the interaction, making the experience even more engaging and enjoyable.

I think text animation is always a fun surprise when someone visits a page. It adds a nice dynamic touch and keeps people engaged. GSAP's text animations are awesome, but I'd use them sparingly so it doesn't feel overwhelming.

With GSAP, I can create both innovative and fun interfaces that captivate with every hover, swipe and click. Additionally, what I liked was how I can use “Flip” to c reate a transition Grid or flex layouts, which I’m not sure exactly how I could integrate this into my project but it is still good to have these ideas/options.

    <h2 class="section-title">Templates and Open UI Kits: HTML5 UP</h2>
    <p class="section-description">
    I explored the templates that HTML5 UP offers and compared them with the ones I found in Bootstrap and Jekyll. Some of the layouts stood out to me as I found them innovative, but some were limiting regarding a lack of sections. That said, I think the Jekyll templates I looked at feel more modern.    </p>

                <h3>Template #1</h3>
                <p>
I found this template compelling because of its simplicity—it's just a grid of photos with no introduction, CTAs, or navigation. The only interaction is clicking on photos for short descriptions, plus an “about” button that opens a pop-up with contact info, social links, and a brief paragraph. However, its minimalism feels limiting, and I would need to add sections like a header, CTAs, and project details to make it more useful.

                <h3>Template #2</h3>
                <p>
The layout of this template caught my eye, especially the brief delay before the photo appears, which creates a dynamic effect. While I found this creative, it also felt limiting, since clicking the buttons doesn't open new sections but only pop-ups. Like the previous template, it lacks depth and space for more structured content.

This template reminded me to the second I analyzed from Bootstrap as the nav bar is on the left side of the page and, while scrolling, the navigation bar remains fixed. There are more similarities between these templates however I felt this one looks more modern. I liked this one more as it plays more with color and has a "get in touch" section.

                    What appealed to me in this template was, once again, the grid of photos, which I find disruptive compared to the layouts we're used to seeing. However, I didn't like the colored overlay on the images, which only disappears on hover, though I know I could edit the template to remove it. Another feature I did enjoy was the hamburger menu, as I hadn't seen it used in any of the other templates.

Overall, this exercise helped me collect templates, animations, and layout ideas I could use in a future project. Some resources felt more useful or modern, for example, Jekyll templates over HTML5, and GSAP animations over Anime.js. I could see myself using a template from either site, depending on my layout preferences and creative direction. For animations, I'd definitely go with GSAP instead of Anime.js, since I really liked the modern gradients and colors it offers. That said, I'd still keep Shadcn UI in mind, as I also enjoyed its animations. I'd just need to make sure my site's design stays consistent if I'm pulling from so many different sources.
