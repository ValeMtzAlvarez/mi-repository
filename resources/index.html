            <p class="section-description">
Important note: doesn't need  Node.js. Runtime: CDN or direct download. I explored a range of free Bootstrap templates to better understand what the framework offers and to evaluate whether the designs align with current web design trends in typography, imagery, and overall style. While I did come across some clean and visually appealing templates, I noticed that several of them felt a bit dated, relying on design patterns that no longer look as modern or polished. Personally, I tend to prefer minimalistic and elegant websites, so I was pleased to find a few options that matched that aesthetic. Below, there are photos of my favorite templates.            </p>

                        <h3>Template #1</h3>
                        <p>
                     I liked this template because of its header, how it integrates with the background picture and has no buttons. I also liked the yellow button in the middle of the page, as I think it's a subtle call to action for users exploring my page.

                          I found this page interesting as the nav bar is on the left side of the page and not on top as it is usually seen. Also, it includes a photo and, while scrolling, the navigation bar remains fixed. The section you are currently viewing is highlighted in white, while the other sections turn gray, making it easy to see where you are on the page.

                         What caught my eye from this landing page was how the images can be seen so close to the short introduction of "I'm Jenny Wilson a Professional..." etc. I think it is interesting as the photos may catch people's attention and make them wander and take a closer look.

            <p class="section-description">
             Important note: Requires Node.js and pnpm/npm. From Shadcn UI, I explored a variety of components, including buttons, switches, drawers, accordions, carousels, and the menubar, among others. What stood out to me most about this website was its intuitiveness, both in terms of navigation and the clarity of its documentation. The component previews are not only visually well-presented but also make it easy to understand how each element can be customized and integrated. Compared to other websites on the list, Shadcn UI felt particularly user-friendly, striking a good balance between functionality and accessibility, which made the learning experience smoother. See the different images to find out which components where my favorite and why.

                         I found the airplane mode button playful, and useful as it conveys the idea of “disconnecting” or pausing activity. I could use it as a fun toggle to change languages or trigger a change in the website's layout, the possibilities are many.

                         The “Open Drawer” button caught my attention as the interaction felt seamless and intuitive, creating a smooth transition. Paired with a nearly full-page pop-up is effective because it allows users to access a large amount of information without leaving the current page.

                            The accordion component is commonly used, yet it remains appealing because it organizes content into collapsible sections, reducing visual clutter and making information easier to navigate and digest.

                        <p>
                            The alert dialog button is appealing because it adds a clear decision point, giving users control and reassurance. Creatively, the button doesn't need to say “alert dialog”; it could read something like “Click here to continue to my page”, with the pop-up delivering a playful or humorous message to engage the user.

            <p class="section-description">
             Important note: Requires Ruby (No Node.js). Jekyll is a program that helps you make websites from simple text. You write your content in Markdown or HTML, and Jekyll turns it into a website with pages that are ready to use. It uses templates to give your site a design and style, and small settings at the top of each file (like the title or date) tell Jekyll how to build each page. Below, I analyze a few Jekyll templates I found interesting.

                        <p>
                         What caught my attention in this template was its modern design, the navigation bar with its dark mode toggle and search bar, as well as the typography and the shde of vibrant blue. It felt modern overall and a plus is the clear use of a CTA button.

                        <p>
                          I found this template interesting because of its use of dark tones and subtle shades, which create a sleek and modern atmosphere compared to the other options I reviewed. Additionally, I liked  the header design, where the logo on the left, the navigation bar in the center, and the search bar on the right.

                            Although it appears simple at first, I chose to include this template in my analysis because I liked several of its features: the navigation bar, the night mode toggle, the typography, and the photo grid below the introduction. I also appreciated the small interactive details, such as the blue button changing color on hover and the navigation links' letters changing color, which add subtle yet engaging touches to the design.

 Important note: doesn't require Node.js. Run time: CDN or direct download. I explored the page Anime.js and spent time searching through the different animations it offered. Honestly, there were many that I didn't quite understand, either how they worked, what their purpose was or how could I use them on a website.

             I really liked the cursor animation because it felt unique and playful. It's not visible in the photo but the group of circles move with a certain curve to it, making it more innoative. I had never seen this type of animation before, which made the interaction feel memorable. It's a great animation for a website since it surprises users and adds a creative touch.

                        <p>
I liked this animation as it breaks the usual pattern of vertical scrolling and feels more interactive. Scrolling horizontally is becoming more common on websites, but I still believe it feels more original and unexpected than scrolling down. The square moving around adds a fun and playful touch to the interaction, making the experience even more engaging and enjoyable.

With GSAP, I can create both innovative and fun interfaces that captivate with every hover, swipe and click. Additionally, what I liked was how I can use “Flip” to c reate a transition Grid or flex layouts, which I’m not sure exactly how I could integrate this into my project but it is still good to have these ideas/options.

That said, I think the Jekyll templates I looked at feel more modern regarding color themes and typography.

I found this template compelling because of its simplicity—it's just a grid of photos with no introduction, CTAs, or navigation. The only interaction is clicking on photos for short descriptions, plus an “about” button that opens a pop-up with contact info, social links, and a brief paragraph. However, its minimalism feels limiting, and I would need to add sections like a header, CTAs, and project details to make it more useful.

                <p>
The layout of this template caught my eye, especially the brief delay before the photo appears, which creates a dynamic effect. While I found this creative, it also felt limiting, since clicking the buttons doesn't open new sections but only pop-ups. Like the previous template, it lacks depth and space for more structured content.

This template reminded me to the second I analyzed from Bootstrap as the nav bar is on the left side of the page and, while scrolling, the navigation bar remains fixed. There are more similarities between these templates however I felt this one looks more modern. I liked this one more as it plays more with color and has a "get in touch" section.

                    What appealed to me in this template was, once again, the grid of photos, which I find disruptive compared to the layouts we're used to seeing. However, I didn't like the colored overlay on the images, which only disappears on hover, though I know I could edit the template to remove it. Another feature I did enjoy was the hamburger menu, as I hadn't seen it used in any of the other templates.

Overall, this exercise helped me collect templates, animations, and layout ideas I could use in a future project. Some resources felt more useful or modern, for example, Jekyll templates over HTML5, and GSAP animations over Anime.js. Before learning more about Node.js in class, I could see myself using a template from either site. However, I now know that using templates that don't require Node.js will be much easier. For animations, I would definitely go with GSAP instead of Anime.js, since I really liked the modern gradients and colors it offers. That said, I would still keep Shadcn UI in mind if it didn't include Node.js as I also enjoyed its animations but I don't want to complicate the project by using Node.js. 

When considering which tools fit my workflow, I'd lean toward GSAP, HTML5 UP, Bootstrap amongst any others that don't use Node.js. GSAP stands out because it gives me precise control over animations while remaining relatively lightweight, making it easier to integrate into static sites or templates without adding unnecessary complexity. HTML5 UP templates appeal to me because they are clean, responsive, and straightforward to customize, which means I can focus on design and layout without being slowed down by complex setups. Bootstrap also fits well into my workflow since it offers a reliable, grid-based structure and pre-styled components, which helps me prototype quickly and ensures consistent responsiveness across devices.

The reason why I'd avoid Node.js dependent tools when possible is that I would have to manage package installations, version conflicts, or a full development environment just to get started.

In terms of trade-offs, I noticed:
* Speed vs. Flexibility: Templates make it faster to start, but customizing them for a unique style can take more time.
* Dependencies vs. Simplicity: GSAP and Shadcn UI add dependencies but offer much richer features compared to simpler, standalone solutions.
* Node.js vs. Standalone: Jekyll works well as a standalone static site generator, whereas tools like Shadcn UI lean on Node.js for full functionality.
* Creativity vs. Convention: Using pre-built templates or design systems saves time but can limit originality, while starting from scratch allows more creative freedom but is slower.

For my portfolio, I'd use either Bootstrap or HTML5 UP templates to quickly build out structured, consistent pages, while customizing them with GSAP animations to showcase interaction design and creativity. Altogether, these tools would allow me to balance efficiency and originality, while presenting a portfolio that feels both modern and personalized.
