            <p class="section-description">
I explored a range of free Bootstrap templates to better understand what the framework offers and to evaluate whether the designs align with current web design trends in typography, imagery, and overall style. While I did come across some clean and visually appealing templates, I noticed that several of them felt a bit dated, relying on design patterns that no longer look as modern or polished. Personally, I tend to prefer minimalistic and elegant websites, so I was pleased to find a few options that matched that aesthetic. Below, there are photos of my favorite templates.            </p>

                        <h3>Template #1</h3>
                        <p>I liked this template because of its header, how it integrates with the background picture and has no buttons. I also liked the yellow button in the middle of the page, as I think it's a subtle call to action for users exploring my page.</p>

            <p class="section-description">
                From Shadcn UI, I explored a variety of components, including buttons, switches, drawers, accordions, carousels, and the menubar, among others. What stood out to me most about this website was its intuitiveness, both in terms of navigation and the clarity of its documentation. The component previews are not only visually well-presented but also make it easy to understand how each element can be customized and integrated. Compared to other websites on the list, Shadcn UI felt particularly user-friendly, striking a good balance between functionality and accessibility, which made the learning experience smoother. See the different images to find out which components where my favorite and why.

                        <h3>Airplane mode</h3>
                        <p>I found the airplane mode button playful, and useful as it conveys the idea of “disconnecting” or pausing activity. I could use it as a fun toggle to change languages or trigger a change in the website's layout, the possibilities are many.</p>

                        <p>The “Open Drawer” button caught my attention as the interaction felt seamless and intuitive, creating a smooth transition. Paired with a nearly full-page pop-up is effective because it allows users to access a large amount of information without leaving the current page. </p>

                        <p>The alert dialog button is appealing because it adds a clear decision point, giving users control and reassurance. Creatively, the button doesn't need to say “alert dialog”; it could read something like “Click here to continue to my page”, with the pop-up delivering a playful or humorous message to engage the user.</p>

            <p class="section-description">
               Jekyll is a program that helps you make websites from simple text. You write your content in Markdown or HTML, and Jekyll turns it into a website with pages that are ready to use. It uses templates to give your site a design and style, and small settings at the top of each file (like the title or date) tell Jekyll how to build each page. Below, I analyze a few Jekyll templates I found interesting.

                        <p>
                         What caught my attention in this template was its modern design, the navigation bar with its dark mode toggle and search bar, as well as the typography and the shde of vibrant blue. It felt modern overall and a plus is the clear use of a CTA button.

                        <p>
                          I found this template interesting because of its use of dark tones and subtle shades, which create a sleek and modern atmosphere compared to the other options I reviewed. Additionally, I liked  the header design, where the logo on the left, the navigation bar in the center, and the search bar on the right.

I explored the page Anime.js and spent time searching through the different animations it offered. Honestly, there were many that I didn't quite understand, either how they worked, what their purpose was or how could I use them on a website. Still, I think it was one of the most fun pages I explored, and in the end I discovered some really interesting animations, as you can see below.

                        <h3>Text animation</h3>
                        <p> 
I liked the text animation because it adds personality, making the content feel more dynamic and engaging. It's a good idea to use it on a website since it helps capture attention quickly and it makes the website feel more modern and interactive.

                        <h3>Cursor animation </h3>
                        <p>
             I really liked the cursor animation because it felt unique and playful. It's not visible in the photo but the group of circles move with a certain curve to it, making it more innoative. I had never seen this type of animation before, which made the interaction feel memorable. It's a great animation for a website since it surprises users and adds a creative touch.

                        <h3>Scroll right animation</h3>
                        <p>
I liked this animation as it breaks the usual pattern of vertical scrolling and feels more interactive. Scrolling horizontally is becoming more common on websites, but I still believe it feels more original and unexpected than scrolling down. The square moving around adds a fun and playful touch to the interaction, making the experience even more engaging and enjoyable.
